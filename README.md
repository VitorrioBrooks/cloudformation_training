=======================

CloudFormation Training class

This repo contains broken cloudformation. 

The lab is to fill in the missing pieces. 

It will boot a Java Application with a MySQL Database decoupled.

If you've finished the lab and everything creates, Test the app by visiting the Sync ELB URL and append :8080/intuit-multi-tier-sync-app/sync/cities. 
This URL will return a sting of cities in JSON.
